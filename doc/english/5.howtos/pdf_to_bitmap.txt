In the Carta Genius' bin directory, there is a shell script named
"pdf_to_bitmap". Its purpose is to convert a PDF file in several
bitmap pictures (one picture per page).

Examples of use:
- You need a JPEG image of game cards? Create a Carta Genius document
  with the margins explicitely set to 0 (zero), with the paper size
  equal to cards' size. Create the PDF file. You should get a PDF with
  one page for each card. Now, convert the PDF to get as many JPEG
  files than cards in the PDF.
- You want to show a card generated with Carta Genius in another
  Carta Genius document? Export the card in JPEG (like explained just
  before), and use it inside the new document.

To use pdf_to_bitmap, you need to have on your computer the ghostscript
program installed (you can get it at http://www.ghostscript.com) in its
GNU or APFL revision. If your PDF file contains transparency, you will
need the 8.14 version or above.

How to use pdf_to_bitmap
========================

1. You need to decide the "dot per inch" resolution of the created
   pictures. This will set the images' pixel size. For example, if
   your PDF pages are 2 inches x 2 inches, and you set a 300 dpi
   resolution, you will get a 600x600 pixels image.
   Higher the dpi resolution is, better the output image is.
2. There is some options:
   a. The output image type. It is JPEG by default, but you can choose
      BMP (bmp16m), PBM (pbm), PNG (png16m), or TIFF (tiff24nc).
   b. You can choose the first and last PDF document's pages to
      process.
   c. It is possible to ask for anti-aliasing on texts and/or graphics
      to get a better result.
3. Type "./pdf_to_bitmap -h" to have the exact command line options.
