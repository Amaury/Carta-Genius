I. PDFLib
---------
You must have PDFLib installed. This library is free when used for an
open-source software as Carta-Genius. You can get the free version of
PDFLib here: http://www.pdflib.com/products/pdflib/download-source.html
(take care of using the version 6 or above)

  1. Download and extract the archive.

  2. Configure PDFLib: `./configure --prefix=/usr'
     (warning: for Mac OS X, see V. section of this document)

  3. Compile the library: `make'

  4. Install it: `make install'

You must be root to do the fourth step. If you can't be root, read
the "III. Static Compilation" paragraph.


II. Dynamic Compilation
-----------------------
Once the PDFLib is compiled and installed in a place known by the
system (like /usr/lib), you can do:

  1. Enter in the Carta-Genius directory and type `./configure' to
     check that all configuration is correct.

  2. Compile the program: `make dynamic'

The executable file named `carta-genius' could be found in the `bin'
directory.
You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source
code directory by typing `make clean'.


III. Static Compilation
-----------------------
If you have compiled PDFLib but you can't install it as root, you can
compile Carta-Genius statically linked to PDFLib.

  1. Compile PDFLib. You will find the static version of the library
     in the sub-directory `libs/pdflib/.libs/'. The file is called
     `libpdf.a'. You will also find the header file `pdflib.h' in
     the sub-directory `libs/pdflib/'.

  2. Copy libpdf.a in the `lib' directory of Carta-Genius. Copy
     pdflib.h in the `include' directory of Carta-Genius.

  3. In the Carta-Genius directory, type `make static'.

The executable file named `carta-genius' could be found in the `bin'
directory.
You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source
code directory by typing `make clean'.


IV. Windows Compilation
-----------------------
To compile and install Carta-Genius under Windows, you need to use
the Cygwin environment. It could be found at http://www.cygwin.com

Under the Cygwin environment, you can compile and install PDFLib like
under Linux (see "I. PDFLib" paragraph).

To compile Carta-Genius, type `make cygwin' in the Carta-Genius
directory.


V. Mac OS X Compilation
-----------------------
Compilation and installation are the same on Mac OS X than on Linux,
except that the configuration step is different. Instead of just
type `./configure --prefix=/usr', you must enter the following
command (all in one line):

CFLAGS=-I/Developer/Headers/FlatCarbon
LDFLAGS="-framework CoreServices -framework ApplicationServices"
./configure

The PDFLib compilation doesn't work if a path element (disk
name, directory, ...) contains a space. Take care about that.

After that, type `make macosx' in the Carta-Genius directory
(works for static compilation).
